# digital_clock
This project implements a 24-hour format digital clock using Verilog HDL on the Basys 3 FPGA board. The clock features functionalities including reset, enable/disable, and custom settings to adjust hours and minutes. The time is displayed on a seven-segment display, offering a clear visual representation of the current time. The project leverages FPGA hardware capabilities to accurately track time and provide user-friendly controls for time adjustments.
